            <p>We often wonder what should we call this food that is so different from the typical North Indian food, Punjabi, Mughlai and Awadhi cuisine. The food we offer is a eclectic mix of the food eaten in homes of Eastern Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Jharkhand. This food is uniquely evolved over generations and highlights the true culture of the people in these places. Our food will take you to the place from where it came from. This is the real essence of Littoo - authentic home style food with whole spices, coal fires, iron skillets and clay griddles. We at Littoo want to introduce this unique blend of Authentic North Indian cuisine to other parts of India. We hope you will love our food and spread the word.</p>
